# TradingView Snapshot Automation

This is a personal Python application designed to automate the process of taking chart snapshots from TradingView. The script uses `PyAutoGUI` to interact with the TradingView interface, `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI), and it provides a configurable number of coins to process.


## How to Use

1. **Install TradingView App**
   - If you haven't TradingView App on your local computer you can download and install it first
   - You can dowload it from [text](https://www.tradingview.com/desktop/)
   - Save your Stocks, Forex, Crypto chart on the watchlist

2. **Run the Application:**
   - If you have the executable (`.exe`), simply double-click to run the program.
   - If you're running the script directly, use a Python environment to execute the script.

3. **Set Number of Coins:**
   - Use the input field in the GUI to specify the number of coins you want to process.

4. **Start the Automation:**
   - Click the "Run" button to begin the automation process. The application will open TradingView, take snapshots for each coin at the specified timeframes, and save the images.

5. **Stop the Automation:**
   - If needed, click the "Stop" button to halt the process at any time.
